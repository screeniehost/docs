# Support

## Community Discord Server

We have a vibrant community on our Discord server where you can ask for help, share your experiences, and connect with other users. Join us on Discord to get support from our community and developers.

## Email Support

If you prefer to reach out via email, you can contact us at `hi@screenie.host`. Currently, matyii is handling all the emails, but as our community grows, we will consider implementing a dedicated support system to better assist you.

## Important Notes

- Please make sure to check our documentation and FAQ section before reaching out for support. Many common questions and issues are already addressed there.
- When asking for help, provide as much detail as possible about your issue. This will help us assist you more effectively.
- Be respectful and patient. Our community and support team are here to help, but response times may vary.
- I try to answer all questions as soon as possible, but please understand that I have a full-time job and private life alongside working on these projects.

Thank you for using screenie!
