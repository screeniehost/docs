# Introduction

Welcome to the screenie's API documentation. This API allows you to interact with the Screenie application programmatically. Below, you'll find information on how to use the API, including authentication methods and available endpoints.

::: warning
The API documentation is not quite finished, as it's missing the correct responses, but it's going to be filled in as soon as possible!

## Authentication

### Upload Key
For uploading files, authentication is handled through an upload key. This key must be included in the request to authorize the upload.

### Admin Access
Admin access is currently managed through login sessions. This will be updated to a more robust authentication method when we move to a new framework.
